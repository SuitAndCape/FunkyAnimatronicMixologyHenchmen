## Generating Stylesheets

### Sass Watch
Before making any modifications to the SCSS files, change to the root directory of your project, and run one of the following commands...

- To compile minified CSS:

``` sh
sass --watch source/scss/famh.scss:public/assets/stylesheets/famh.min.css --style compressed
```

- To compile standard CSS:

``` sh
sass --watch source/scss/famh.scss:public/assets/stylesheets/famh.css
```

## Overlaps

- Make note of FunkyAnimatronicMixologyHenchmen and RAPTORSMACSS overlap

``` scss
// `_famh-config.scss` and RAPTORSMACSS' `_config.scss` overlaps
$clear
$gallery
$ebony
```

``` scss
// `_famh-variables.scss` and RAPTORSMACSS' `_variables.scss` overlaps
$html-font-size
$body-font-size
$body-bg-color
```

``` scss
// `_funkulators.scss` and RAPTORSMACSS' `_functions.scss` overlaps
@function pxrem(){}
@function pxem(){}
```

``` scss
// `_henchmen.scss` and RAPTORSMACSS' `_helpers.scss` overlaps
.center-align, %center-align
.clearfix, %clearfix
.no-bullets, %no-bullets
```

## ToDos

- Decide whether to continue using `@mixin prefixer`, [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), or [Gulp-Autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer)
- Write thorough documentation or instructional `.md` file(s) explaining how to use everything
- Develop more animations and functions
- Include logo, when developed
- Include favicon, when developed (maybe)
- Create separate Animatronics repo
- Create [RAPTORSMACSS](https://github.com/SuitAndCape/RAPTORSMACSS) tie-in repo
